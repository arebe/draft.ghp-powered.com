I am Greg Hanawalt and I have an amazing way to power your next outdoor event ... Solar charged batteries!
<br><br>
Until now, finding power for an outdoor event has not always been easy ... and often the source has been less than ideal. If you were lucky, a long cable run was all that was required ... If you were not  ... There was a noisy generator at the other end of that long cable run.
<br><br>
As owner of Strand Sound I have been setting up sound and lighting systems for a wide range of events since 1982.
<br><br>
In 2012 I started powering some of those events using solar charged batteries.
<br><br>
No noise, no fumes and no long cable runs ...
<br><br>
Just quiet, clean, reliable power ... Wherever, whenever you want it!
