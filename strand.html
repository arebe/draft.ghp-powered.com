    <h1>Strand Sound</h1>
    <br><br>
I'm Greg Hanawalt.
<br><br>
I started Strand Sound in 1982 to offer Boston area bands a nice sounding reliable and affordable alternative when they needed a sound system. More than thirty years later that is still my goal.
<br><br>
I get to serve many different types of events every year ... From the Hingham Cabaret in January to the Urban Nutcracker in December ... With concerts, dance parties, fashion shows, festivals, fundraisers, school musicals, silent films and Winchester's Town Day in between!
<br><br>
Outdoor concerts are a particular favorite of mine ... And I have put together a pretty neat rig to get around most of the problems associated with working outdoors ...
<br><br>
Which leads to my most recent project ... GHP Powered ... A wonderful way of powering outdoor events that you will have to see to believe!
<br><br>
GHP-Powered.com ... The quietest power you will never hear!
